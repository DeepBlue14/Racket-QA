###**Racket-Doc**

####**Project Description**
A documentation generator for the Racket language.  It will extract documentation from source files and generate it into files which can be displayed in a web page.  The web server is by default running on the local host; however, this can easily be modified by changing a single line in WebMaster.rkt.
####**Preparation**
To write documentation to be analyzed and generated by the application you must use the following syntax, which experienced programmers will recognize as similar to traditional JavaDoc.
```
#||
 |This procedure does so-and-so
 |
 |@param num This is a number which will have
 |	     something...
 |@return Returns #t if ... else #f
 |#
(define (name-of-proc num)
.
.
.
```
**Note**:Since this program is still under construction, add documentation to ALL defined procs & data. *(Currently, the program does NOT link certain documentation with code blocks; it assumes there is a one-to-one relationship between defined proc/data and documentation segment.)*

####**Build & Run**
**DOWN FOR MAINTENANCE**.  Should be fully operational by 02/18/2015.
*Note: This program has only been tested in a Linux environment.  It might not work with Windows, because of the different filesystem path conventions.*
