###**Racket-Doc**
![Logo](https://github.com/DeepBlue14/Racket-Doc/blob/master/share/racket1.jpg)


####**Project Description**
A documentation generator for the Racket language.  It will extract documentation and specified attributes from source files and generate code for a web server and web pages, with the extracted data imbeded.  The web server is by default running on the local host; however, this can easily be modified by changing a single line in the output source file.


####**Preparation**
To write documentation to be analyzed and generated by the application you must use the following syntax, which experienced programmers will recognize as similar to traditional JavaDoc.
```scheme
#||
 |This procedure does so-and-so
 |
 |@param num This is a number which will have
 |	     something...
 |@return Returns #t if ... else #f
 |#
(define (name-of-proc num)
.
.
.
```
**Note**:
- There should be a one-to-one ratio between procedures/defined variables and documentation; i.e. **every** precedure and global variable should have documentation.
- Global variables **cannot** be defined on one line.  The should be defined in over two lines--for example:
```scheme
(define five
     5)
```
- **Do not** put other comments *on there own line*.  For example,
```scheme
(+ 2 4) ;;this adds two numbers
```
is **ok**, but
```scheme
;;this adds two numbers
(+ 2 4)
```
is **not ok**.


####**Build & Run**

**Optional**:
This package includes a css file if you would like more elegent web pages to
be generated.  If so, copy and past the directory **httdocs** *(found in Racket-QA/Racket-Doc/ )*
into a directory right above of your output destination directories.

**Required**:
Run "master-gui.rkt".  Select an option from the radio buttons: "file" if you wish to process only one file, or "directory" if you wish to process all the *.rkt files under a given directory.
Select an output destination (directory).
The output will be stored to in the location in a file named ```racketDocOutput.rkt```.
Run this file.


####** Important Note**

Since there is an almost infinate variety of input the user can give it, there are obviously limitations, some of which may be untested.  So don't give the project anything too weird to process.  For example, it has been known to crash when given code containing regular expressions.

I suggest that you use the sample code in the "**tests**" folder, at least to begin with.
