###**Racket-Doc**
![Logo](https://github.com/DeepBlue14/Racket-Doc/blob/master/share/racket1.jpg)


####**Project Description**
A documentation generator for the Racket language.  It will extract documentation from source files and generate it into files which can be displayed in a web page.  The web server is by default running on the local host; however, this can easily be modified by changing a single line in WebMaster.rkt.
####**Preparation**
To write documentation to be analyzed and generated by the application you must use the following syntax, which experienced programmers will recognize as similar to traditional JavaDoc.
```
#||
 |This procedure does so-and-so
 |
 |@param num This is a number which will have
 |	     something...
 |@return Returns #t if ... else #f
 |#
(define (name-of-proc num)
.
.
.
```
**Note**:Since this program is still under construction, it is currently rather picky about several characteristics which I intend to fix before the final release:
- There should be a one-to-one ratio between procedures/global variables and documentation; i.e. **every** precedure and global variable should have documentation.  Any which do not will be ignored.
- Global variables **cannot** be defined on one line.  The should be defined in over two lines--for example:
```
(define five
     5)
```
- Module for generating documentation for an entire directory is in progress--do not attempt to use it yet. 

####**Build & Run**
Run "MainGui.rkt".  Select a *.rkt source file or directory.  Do NOT select an output destination.  The output will be stored to ~/Racket-QA/Racket-Doc/output/WebPage.rkt.  Run that file to view documentation.
*Note: This program has only been tested in a Linux environment.  It might not work with Windows, because of the different filesystem path conventions.*
